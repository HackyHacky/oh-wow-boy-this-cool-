# **Some Admin Remastered**

Some Admin Remastered (SAR) is an **open sourced** admin developed by
experts that have been making admins for over half a decade. SAR is designed to work
best for **[Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to)**. Also, we strive to make SAR
a **powerful** admin with the best **performance** and **security** possible.

## **Usage**

To use SAR, you will need to open the command bar via **semi-colon** or by using the
default chat. If the current game you're using SAR with is using a **custom chat**, the
chat commands will **not** work.

#### **Regular Commands**

```
    <prefix> <commandName> <arguments>
```

#### **Loop Commands**

```
    <prefix> <commandName> <arguments> <loopAmount (Optional)> <loopDelay (Optional)>
```
